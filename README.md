        “Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art”

  <p>Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
         Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night</p>
<p>And watching, with eternal lids apart,
         Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,</p>
<p>The moving waters at their priestlike task
         Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,</p>
<p>Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
         Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—</p>
<p>No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
         Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,</p>
<p>To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
         Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,</p>
<p>Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.</p>
    </p>
